# Protoform
Basic platformer (a la Mario/Sonic) 

Modeled after classic running/jumping platformers like Mario, this game takes place in a series of odd, snowy landscapes populated
with several goofy monsters (credits to my sprite providers). The player is a swordsman, who can swing his blade to attack, jump,
and run. Portals mark scene shift points, and reaching the final portal is a win. The player takes damage by colliding with enemies, dying upon reaching zero health or falling off the bottom of the stage.

*Game is ran at around 100 FPS and is not as efficient with collisions as it could be. 
Scaling upwards may cause significant performance drops.
